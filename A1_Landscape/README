Code initializes a double char array with % on the border and . for every other location other than newlines at
    the end of each row. 


run with ./land

Each zone: tall grass, mountains/boulders, water, trees, has a method that randomly places a region.
Roads and Marts are placed after the constuction of the map

zone location struct is UNUSED in the final implementation 
growth function is UNUSED in the final implementation

I played around with the thought of using a stuct and assigning random locations for different bodies
    I would then grow each zone out from its randomly selected location until it reaches another zone.
    I ran out of time and did not finish this implementation, i might explore it more in the future.
