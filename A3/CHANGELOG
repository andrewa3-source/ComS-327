Jan 26th - Created directory and land.c file
Jan 29th - Made init and road functions. 
    This initializes the map and connects the roads randomly from top to bottem and left to right.
    
Jan 29th Afternoon - created a function to randomly place tall grass regions
    I then used this function to replicate it for the rest of the uniqe areas, this includes boulders, 
    trees, water, etc.

Jan 30th - Finalizing Code, looking into different implementation of areas using a 
    growth system. created zoneloco struct and growth function

Feb 1st - Added new line charecters to the end of each row in my double charecter array used for holding   
    the data for the map. Added some more instances of water and trees around the map.

Feb 6th - Begun working on assignment. Created copy of initial assignment, created individual map struct including 
    location of each gate. Made global array of pointers to individual maps. Worked with this for a while with many issues.

Feb 7th - continued with assignment, ran into issue when initializing individual maps. Decided to change to instructors version of 1.01. 
    Created global array, edited many function parameters to either include the global array, or the location of current map.

Feb 8th - initialized global array to null, ensured gate locations when moving through maps. Created probability for centers and marts when moving further
    from the center. Made it so the player cannot move out of the array boundaries.
