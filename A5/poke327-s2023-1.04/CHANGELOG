Jan 26th - Created directory and land.c file
Jan 29th - Made init and road functions. 
    This initializes the map and connects the roads randomly from top to bottem and left to right.
    
Jan 29th Afternoon - created a function to randomly place tall grass regions
    I then used this function to replicate it for the rest of the uniqe areas, this includes boulders, 
    trees, water, etc.

Jan 30th - Finalizing Code, looking into different implementation of areas using a 
    growth system. created zoneloco struct and growth function

Feb 1st - Added new line charecters to the end of each row in my double charecter array used for holding   
    the data for the map. Added some more instances of water and trees around the map.

Feb 6th - Begun working on assignment. Created copy of initial assignment, created individual map struct including 
    location of each gate. Made global array of pointers to individual maps. Worked with this for a while with many issues.

Feb 7th - continued with assignment, ran into issue when initializing individual maps. Decided to change to instructors version of 1.01. 
    Created global array, edited many function parameters to either include the global array, or the location of current map.

Feb 8th - initialized global array to null, ensured gate locations when moving through maps. Created probability for centers and marts when moving further
    from the center. Made it so the player cannot move out of the array boundaries. 

Feb 11th - Began working on assignment 1.03, Created copy of existing dijkstas algo to use for pathing. Began researching the algorithm to see how 
    exactly to implement this for the player.

Feb 12th - Changed the way the the character is placed on the map, this included some small changes to the map struct to include player cords in 
    the way of a pair. This makes it easier to call for the position in the dijkstas implementation.

Feb 13th - Began to alter the algorithm to work for the player pathing, Was very confused for a while and started researching how to exactly 
    implement the cost changes.

Feb 18th - Created an array for the hikers costs based on different terrains. Mostly finished the begining of the algorithm where we initialize 
    all cost to int max and only input valid terrain types for the hiker.

Feb 19th - Made all the checks for the 8 surrounding tiles. Troubleshooted for hours and segfaulted 100+ times. Quit working because I was mad.

Feb 20th - Woke up and somehow the segfaults stopped with a small tweak. Trouble shot some small cost issues where I was subtracting in the wrong
    spot. Now the method works 100% for the hiker.

    Later same day, Made new method for the rival. Created a rival array for costs depending on terrain. Implemented the method in the same way 
    I made the hiker implementation. Updated README

March 19th - Started Working on assignment(yeah I know I procrstinated and it will probably show in my grade I'm sorry I will do better), Imported ncurses and set the print_map function to use the ncurses screen. This worked for first game screen but didn't update yet.

March 20th - added new information to the game loop so the space bar would cycle the npcs and q would exit the game, started working on character movement

March 21st - had a lot of issues with character movement but finally figured it out. Implemented the pathfind everytime the character moves so the main game function is done.

March 22nd - Ensured character movement was okay. Added the input to the centers and marts with respective exits. I messed with trying to get a window popup to work for like 4 hours but couldnt get any method to work. I think this is because my actually game is just on the screen and not in its own window but i'm not sure. Instead i just had menu information be displayed on the bottem three lines of the terminal. Once that worked I started working on the npc menu, again just in the bottem of the screen because I couldn't figure out the pop up. Debugged this for a while and finally got it working for the most part. I tryed implementing a popup for npc battles but failed and I really don't know the best way to do it so I'm cutting my losses.
