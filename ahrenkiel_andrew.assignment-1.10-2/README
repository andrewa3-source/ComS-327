For this assignment I added pokemon Gyms!

Gyms are currently generated with the same odds as a center or mart for simplicity and being able to access easily for demo purposes
Idealy it would have much lower chance or fixed location in the world.

In each gym there is a new unique npc type that is a gym trainer
Gym trainers will have a full team of high level pokemon as they are intended to be a boss battle for game progression

In the gym I changed the controls to use wasd instead of the usual numbers or whatever as i like that more

You can challenge the gym trainer by walking up to him
You will have to leave and re enter to challenge him again, which makes sense as you will need to heal your pokemon anyways.

to exit just press q or walk out the door.
